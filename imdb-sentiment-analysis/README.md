## 🧩 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration
```python
python sentiment_analysis.py
```
- Loads 50K reviews from CSV
- Analyzes data balance and structure
- Generates visualizations

### 2️⃣ Text Preprocessing
- Remove HTML tags, punctuation, numbers
- Convert to lowercase
- Tokenization
- Stopword removal
- Lemmatization

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Word cloud visualizations
- Sentiment distribution charts
- Review length analysis
- Most frequent words

### 4️⃣ Feature Engineering
